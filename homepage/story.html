                <p>Hi guys! I'm Katie. Currently I'm still studying design and digital media in my master's. I am a person, who plans everything, so I try to learn already about superannuation, because I have to start saving for my retirement in one year, when I start working. I informed myself about several different superannuation provider already, but I like most BestSuper. Especially for young people like me, who are still studying, they are really good. They offer so much information about all different possibilities and advantages and disadvantages. I really have the feeling that they know what to do. I will choose BestSuper as superannuation provider next years, because I really feel good with them!</p>

                <p>My name is Erdem! As an junior tax consultant at an international company I am quite used to deal with all financial topics. Therefor I really want to have a good superannuation provider and to be safe for my retirement. Of course I could do more or less all by myself, but BestSuper makes everything for me in the best possible way. That's perfect! So I have more time to spend with my family and my two small children. BestSuper offers me the best way for superannuation, without any work for myself. I like that!</p>

                <p>Hi I am Chris! I am working as a project manager in an IT start-up. To have a good work-life balance and to have fun in my job are two very important things in my life. As an educated programmer I don't know a lot about finance topics or superannuation, so I am really happy, that BestSuper supports me so well. I know that I will be very about that when I retire. Of course, at the moment I only want to enjoy my life and have fun, nice job and friends, but I still think a little bit about the future. I guess we all should be more responsible about our own future! BestSuper offers me here the easiest way. Perfect preperation for myself, when I am old, but at the moment I don't have to care about it. They do all for me! Thank BestSuper!!</p>
