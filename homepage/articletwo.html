                <p class="title">The rising cost of raising kids</p>
                <p class="info"> - Finance, 3 min read, 18 March, 2016 - </p>
                <p class="targetgroup"> - Main target group: 30 to 39 years - </p>
                <p>It may not come as a surprise to some, but it’s now more expensive than ever to raise kids. According to recent research, the cost to bring up two children from birth to adulthood for a typical middle-income Australian family is now $812,000<sup>1</sup> – up from $537,000 in 2007, and almost double that of 2002 when it cost $448,000.</p>
                <p>While this cost has risen by around 50 per cent since 2007, household incomes over the same period have only grown by 25 per cent – meaning the growth in the cost of raising children is double that of income growth. But don’t despair. There are a whole range of things you might be able to do to save a few dollars.</p>
                <p>Here are a few useful tips that may be worth considering:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Buy used</strong> – whether it’s online or from op shops, you might be surprised at the quality of used toys and clothes you can pick up, at a fraction of the cost of buying them new. Just be aware that it’s not recommended to buy used cots or car seats.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use your local library</strong> – it’s free to join and gives you access to a massive range of books, movies and music. Plus, some libraries run craft activities and storytelling sessions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cook at home</strong> – cut back on eating out or getting take away food. Not only will it save you money but it’s usually way healthier for the family.</li>
                    <li><strong>Get rid of pay TV</strong> – with more and more channels becoming available through free to air TV, and many shows now also available online, this is one luxury that could be using up quite a bit of your budget.</li>
                    <li><strong>Holiday differently</strong> – instead of overseas adventures, maybe scale things back a bit and go camping. Not only is it extremely cost effective, but it’s a great way for the family to get outdoors and really experience nature. Or maybe consider a house swap – another great, inexpensive holiday alternative.</li>
                    <li><strong>Get budgeting</strong> – to get a true idea of where your money is going, a budget is essential. Check outhoweasyitistomanageyourfinanceswithBestSuper’saward-winning2 online tool Money Map.</li>
                    <li><strong>Apply for sporting grants</strong> – the Queensland Government offers various grants to help get kids into sport and pay for things like club memberships, travel, uniforms and equipment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Look at dental programs</strong> – the Australian Government’s Child Dental Benefit Schedule provides up to $1,000 per child to cover services such as dental examinations, x-rays and fillings. It is means tested though, so take a look at all the details online.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You’ll find a treasure trove of other simple cost-saving ideas online, so have a dig around to see what else is out there. The great thing is that many of the ideas are not about missing out, but just doing things differently.</p>
                <p>So while it’s now more expensive than ever to raise kids (and it doesn’t look like slowing down anytime soon), they can of course provide you with a lifetime of love and happiness. And you can’t put a price on that.</p>

                <p class="comment">"Lot of information in your articles. And the possibility to see articles for different target groups, so I can read/prepare myself more for my future, is very good as well. Your online magazin offers more than the printed version and better for the environment is it, too."</p>
